### Solution

This is a classic problem in interviewing. It is easy to calculate 6 * 17, but it is not so easy to calculate 6 + 17.

This problem is to test the logical thinking of the interviewee.

The interviewer will ask you to calculate 6 + 17, and then ask you to calculate the next problem.

If you calculate 6 + 17 = 23, the interviewer will be very satisfied with you.

If you can't calculate the
